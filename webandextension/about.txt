About SherPass
==============

SherPass is a program to **manage passwords**, both for web sites and SSH access.

It uses the [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/)
to [PGP-encrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) login/password
entries. By encrypting an entry with possibly multiple persons' public keys, several
people will be able to obtain access to the password entry, each using his own
private key. This allows password information for hosts or websites to be **shared**
among several people, without needing a single master key.

To manage passwords, download the standalone program for your operating system. To
be able to use passwords in web pages more easily, you can use

 - the Google Chrome [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sherpass/ojlpghfphhbjkplpncihjookelhgphgj)
 - the bookmarklet ('SherPassLet') on the [main web site](https://j0r1.github.io/SherPass/)

The [manual](#manual) explains how both the standalone program and the bookmarklet/extension
can be used.

Manual
------

The main SherPass program works with two directories:

 1. A directory with PGP _public_ keys which can be used to encrypt login/password entries.
 2. A directory in which each file is an login/password entry that has been encrypted with
    one or more public keys from the other directory. The people who have a matching
    _private_ key (and the corresponding passphrase) can decrypt these entries and view
    the login/password information.

By using shared directories for this (e.g. using a shared filesystem like NFS, or something
like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)), this makes a shared password system possible. In this
system each person can still have his own private key and passphrase, no globally known password
or key is necessary.
