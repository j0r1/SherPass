<h1>About SherPass</h1>

<p>SherPass is a program to <strong>manage passwords</strong>, both for web sites and SSH access.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a>
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP-encrypt</a> login/password
entries. By encrypting an entry with possibly multiple persons' public keys, several
people will be able to obtain access to the password entry, each using his own
private key. This allows password information for hosts or websites to be <strong>shared</strong>
among several people, without needing a single master key.</p>

<p>To manage passwords, download the standalone program for your operating system. To
be able to use passwords in web pages more easily, you can use</p>

<ul>
<li>the Google Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sherpass/ojlpghfphhbjkplpncihjookelhgphgj">browser extension</a></li>
<li>the bookmarklet ('SherPassLet') on the <a href="https://sherpass-lite.appspot.com">main web site</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#manual">manual</a> explains how both the standalone program and the bookmarklet/extension
can be used.</p>

<h2>Programs</h2>

<p>Installable packages for various platforms:</p>

<h2>Manual</h2>

<p>The main SherPass program works with two directories:</p>

<ol>
<li>A directory with PGP <em>public</em> keys which can be used to encrypt login/password entries.</li>
<li>A directory in which each file is an login/password entry that has been encrypted with
one or more public keys from the other directory. The people who have a matching
<em>private</em> key (and the corresponding passphrase) can decrypt these entries and view
the login/password information.</li>
</ol>

<p>By using shared directories for this (e.g. using a shared filesystem like NFS, or something
like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>), this makes a shared password system possible. In this
system each person can still have his own private key and passphrase, no globally known password
or key is necessary.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>This first movie demonstrates how you can configure SherPass. In this video, SherPass has already
been installed. Once started, the following steps are performed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The public key directory and the directory to use for the login/password entries are created and
selected in the configuration dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>The necessary information is entered to generate a private/public key pair. Depending on the
complexity, generating a keypair can take a while, much longer than is shown in the video here.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'TCP server' is enabled, and an access URL and AES encryption key are generated. This allows
the bookmarklet/extension to connect directly to the running SherPass application. The first 
random string is needed for a correct URL, which should help to prevent other web pages from 
connecting to the main application. The data sent is also encrypted using the second random
string as an extra safety measure.</p></li>
<li><p>A prefix for the filenames which will contain the public/private keys is entered. In this case, the
SherPass configuration directory will store the private key in <code>jori.privkey</code>, while the public
key <code>jori.pubkey</code> is automatically stored in the directory for the public keys.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding password entries</h3>

<p>In this movie you can see two login/password entries being added. One is for SSH access while the other
contains information which can be used on a website. Each of these entries will correspond to a file that
is stored in the 'password info directory' from the configuration phase above.</p>

<p>For an entry of type 'SSH', the specified host/IP will be used when launching an SSH session. For a type
of 'HTTP' or 'HTTPS', that host/IP line is actually interpreted as a regular expression and is used to filter
the entries so that only relevant entries are shown in the bookmarklet or Chrome extension.</p>

<script>addDownloadURL("s/ccj562z7a55fvn2/sherpass_ssh.webm");</script>

<h3>Starting an SSH session</h3>

<p>To be able to SSH to a specific entry, you just need to make sure that the entry is of type 'SSH'. Pressing
the <code>SSH</code> button in the user interface will then launch the command specified in the configuration dialog.
On GNU/Linux, the <a href="http://sshpass.sourceforge.net/">sshpass</a> program is used to specify the SSH password using an
environment variable while on MS-Windows this is done on the command line using 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">putty.exe</a>. Needless to say, passing a
password as a plain text argument or as an environment variable is not the most secure solution, so use
with care!</p>

<p>In the 'SSH command' specified in the configuration dialog, a number of substitutions will be made:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The hostname (<em>%h</em>) and port number (<em>%P</em>) will be derived from the 'Host/IP' line in a password
entry. For example, if this line says <code>my.hostname.com:8022</code>, then the host will be <code>my.hostname.com</code>
and the port number will be 8022.</p></li>
<li><p><em>%u</em> will be replaced by the contents of the 'Login' line in the password entry.</p></li>
<li><p><em>%p</em> will be replaced by the contents of the 'Password' line in the password entry. Note that you
may not need this if you're passing the password as an environment variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<script>addDownloadURL("s/4oaou6epoh36jyv/sherpass_website.webm");</script>

<h3>Using the website</h3>

<p>You can get an overview of your password entries using the <a href="https://sherpass.appspot.com">SherPass web site</a>.
The login/password entries can be obtained in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first way is by putting your password entries in a Dropbox directory and getting the
'share' link to this directory using the Dropbox web site. You'll also have to store your private
key on Dropbox and obtain a link to it in a similar way. Making your private key available
on the internet in this way is probably not the most secure practice, but in some cases it
may be useful to access your password entries without having to run the standalone SherPass
program.</p></li>
<li><p>The second approach is the one which is shown in the movie, and instructs the code from the web
site to connect to the SherPass program running on your computer. To allow the web site to
access the password entries that are currently loaded in the SherPass program, we need to
copy-paste the access URL and the AES encryption key specified in the configuration dialog.</p></li>
</ol>

<script>addDownloadURL("s/ktnjemvl45vpzpb/sherpass_bookmarklet.webm");</script>

<h3>Using the bookmarklet</h3>

<p>The main web site also contains a bookmarklet called 'SherPassLet'. You can install it in your
browser by just dragging it to the bookmarks bar. This is a small utility that lets you access
data stored in the login/password entries and use these data in another web page.</p>

<p>In the movie, we just surf to <code>google.com</code> and click on the SherPassLet. You'll see that suddenly
an input field becomes greenish. When double clicking (or swiping) this input field, an overlay appears
with matching password entries for this site. The password entries are retrieved using one of the
two methods described in the previous step, in this case by connecting to the running SherPass
program.</p>

<p>The simple example does not have a matching site, so no entries are displayed. When the 'filter' 
option is disabled however, you'll see that our two login/password entries are shown. When you
double click (or swipe) one of the fields, the text from that field is entered in the (now greenish) 
input field that was double clicked earlier.</p>

<h3>Using the Chrome extension</h3>

<p>As you can see in this video, if you're using the Chrome browser you can also install a Chrome
extension with the same functionality as the bookmarklet. Because everything is locally installed
on your computer it should be slightly faster. You will need to enter your Dropbox URLs or access
codes again if you're using the extension though, but these settings will also be remembered.</p>
